Data Glossing

The coders gathered the data from the directory `for_glossing`. Such directory includes data from the repositories `channumerals`, `barlowpacific`, `sand`, and `bowernnumerals` in the root of this organization, as well as the `ZariquieyPano13` repository accessible from https://zenodo.org/records/14010833.

The coders glossed the data following Russell Barlow's glossing guidelines. 

Data from different glossers were merged and sanity checked with the scripts in the directory `Sanity_checks`. 

The final glossed data is accessible from the file `all.data.checked.csv`
