Ama numbers 6, 7, 8, 9 look like cognates with Dilling 6, 7, 8, 9. This stands to reason as Dilling is the local hub town for the Ama. The Dilling language is now dying (Mugaddam 2007) and Arabic is used in the town instead, so the incorporation of Dilling numbers into Ama (if it was that way round) must date back to a time before the shift to Arabic. Ama has three tone marksː high (á) mid (ā) low (à) Dr. Angelika Jakobi’s commentary on Ama numeralsː Russel Norton suggests that the Ama numerals 6, 7, 8, 9 are borrowed from the Dilling language (genetically belonging to Kordofan Nubian). As the Ama area is not only geographically close to Dilling but also to other Kordofan Nubian languages like Karko, Wali and Ghulfan Morung I doubt that it is possible to identify the Kordofan Nubian language from which Ama borrowed those numerals. Apart from 6, 7, 8, 9, there is evidence that tárfó 20 is also a borrowing from a Kordofan Nubian language. The direction of borrowing from Kordofan Nubian to Nyimang (rather than vice versa) is suggested by the fact that cognates of the numerals 6, 7, 8, 9 (but not 20) are attested in other Nubian languages, too, which are spoken in the Nile valley and Darfur (i.e. outside of the Kordofan Nubian and Ama area).

Individually these words are not attested.

The Baraïn are located in the southern part of the Guera near the town of Melfi and south and west of the town (département de Bahr Signaka, sous-préfecture de Melfi).

The language is classified in the Afro-Asiatic family as an East-Chadic language. It's sub-group includes Sokoro, Saba and Tamki and is called B3 or the Sokoro group. The digits 6-9 are transcribed phonetically as one word although they are more than likely a compound of the word for 5 (thought it drops its [w]) then the coordinate /iŋ/ which totally assimilates to the following consonant. The variation in the second vowel is consistent with some type of vowel harmony seen in other environments. The words originally given for 20 & 30 were later identified by the speakers as Bagirmi (a nearby language). The words for 100 and 1000 appear to have come from Hausa. The morpheme [ke] seen in numbers 11-19 was used in one other place as an adverb with the meaning of “more” or “still” (French: encore).

There are five different dialects with some phonological and grammatical differences, but the numeral system is the same for all of them. (The basic numeral vocabulary is the same, too, with some differences in pronunciation due to the dialectal differences.). A note on orthography: ŋ and ɗ are used like their IPA counterparts, while ƴ represents the palatal implosive ʄ. ba means ''and''; orror is the plural of orro ''ten''. tayaaka is reminiscent of the feminine form of the adjective toyooko ''big'', although the feminine adjective is usually yaaka. I am not sure about the meaning of tape. ku in tape ku ɗuŋkuleek is a plural relative pronoun, while ɗuŋkuleek is a plural form of a different adjective which also means ''big''. For numbers over 99, many speakers tend to use the Chadian Arabic words instead (e.g. miya instead of orror orro). For talking about money, they use the same system as Chadian Arabic, referring to ''riyal'' instead of Central African Francs.

There are separate units for the numerals ‘zero’ to ‘ten’ in Igala. There are also other separate forms for higher units; óɡʷú for ‘twenty’, ódʒe for ‘fifty’, ɔ̀ɡbʷá ɔ́kɔ́ for ‘two hundred’ úlú (ɔ́kɔ́) for ‘four hundred’, óɡwúmétʃi for ‘seven hundred’, and the highest unit is ítʃámû ‘eight hundred’ in this hierarchy. The units for ‘two hundred’ and ‘four hundred’ may occur with an optional expression, ɔ́kɔ́‘money’. This may be a pointer to the fact that these units came into the numeral system with the invention of money in Igala economy at some. Other units in the numeral system are the morpheme òké ‘unit’, the overt addition morpheme, ɲú, the multiplication morpheme, mɔ́ and the subtraction morpheme, tʃì. For addition in the numeral system, the lower base numerals, particularly ‘one’ to ‘ten’, are used for counting the additions up to ‘nineteen’ in phrase combination with whatever is added. After these juxtapositions, there is the new unit, ógʷú for ‘twenty’. Observe above that there is a special form for ‘one’ in the combination meaning ‘eleven (ten plus one)’, using the alternate/clitic form, kâ instead of the fully-fledged ǒkâ morpheme. This alternate form also occurs everywhere else where the sum of addition brings the number to ‘plus one’ in the numeral system. Observe from the set of examples that beyond ‘twenty’, in the addition of ‘one’, a new morpheme, ɲú (lit. enter) ‘add’ is attached obligatorily before the added value. In counting ‘plus one’ in the thousandth, the morpheme, òké ‘unit’ makes ‘one’ an optional expression, as the sense of ‘unit’ may stand at this rate to also express ‘plus one’, as is shown in ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké (mɔ̂ kâ) ‘one thousand and one’. The addition template, ɲú ((òké) mɔ́, is utilized generally in the higher numerals from ‘twenty’ in adding forms of the lower numerals generally. For numeral values lower than ‘thousand’; from ‘twenty’ upwards, even though the expression òké ‘unit’ may be utilized, it is phonologically optional as is shown using the brackets in the numeral examples. The simple additive morpheme, ɲú may also be used in isolation for addition. This is the case in instances such as ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ mɔ́ ɲú ódʒe (lit. two hundred add fifty), ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷɔ̀ mɔ́ ɛ̀lú (lit. eight hundred add one hundred) ‘eight hundred’ and ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ (lit. eight hundred add two hundred) ‘one thousand’. Whereas in phrasal combinations for simple additions of the lower numerals, ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’, the structural means is generally by the juxtaposition of ‘ten’, the highest unit of the base numerals that can be paired with other units below it; juxtaposition for the purpose of addition in the higher numerals is restricted only to the two isolates in the system, óɡʷú ɛ̀ɡʷá (twenty + ten) ‘thirty’ and úlú ɔ̀ɡʷá (four hundred + two hundred) ‘six hundred’. The hierarchy of occurrence is generally from a bigger number to a lower one without exception. Thus, the forms * ɔ̀ɡʷá úlú (two hundred + four hundred), * ɛ̀ɡʷá óɡʷú (ten + twenty) and maybe *ɛ̀ta ɛ̀ɡʷa (three + ten) are deviant structures for addition. ɛ̀ta ɛ̀ɡʷá ‘sixty’ however occurs, but as the sum shows, this case is rather for multiplication, and the ɛ̀ta form here is actually a shortened form for the underlying ɔ̀ɡbɔ̀ mɔ́ ɛta ɛ̀ɡʷá (twenty multiply three x ten) rather than simply *ɛ̀ta ɛ̀ɡʷa(three + ten), which is deviant. One other interesting fact of the Igala numeral system is revealed in the hierarchical organization of its metric system. It seems clear from the occurrence in the language of òké ‘unit’ between higher numerals and numerals between ‘one’ and ‘ninteen’ that numerals ‘one’ to ‘nineteen’ are considered mere units of the lower numerals to be added to higher numerals. This system would contrast with languages like English in which the units are ‘one’ through ‘nine’ only. Observe the following examples, 1001 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké (mɔ́ kâ) 1002 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ èdʒì 1010 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ ɛ̀ɡʷá 1019 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ ɛ̀ɡʷá ɛ̀lá 1020 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ óɡʷú 1050 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ ódʒe As the ungrammaticality of the treatment of ‘twenty’ and ‘fifty’ as units in ‘one thousand and twenty’ and ‘one thousand and thirty’ suggests, these are not lower units in Igala, even though nineteen in ‘one thousand and nineteen’ is demonstrated to be considered a unit. Thus for English it may be ‘units’, ‘tens’, ‘hundreds’, ‘thousands’, etc, for Igala it is ‘units’, ‘twenties’, ‘fifties’, ‘two hundreds’, ‘four hundreds’ and ‘eight hundreds’.",0.246913580246914,1,NA

The numeral tor-dúma '10' is is morphologically complex. It consists of the stem tor- ‘10’ plus the building morpheme for tens, -duma, and could thus literally be translated as ''ten-ty''. As shown in the above table, the subsequent tens ('20', '30', …, '90') are formed through multiplication. The numbers from 2 to 9 serve as multipliers, -duma as multiplicand. A long vowel is located between multiplier and multiplicand. This vowel is mostly -aa (see, for instance, ont-aa-dúma '50'), in one case -oo (see lam-oo-dúma '20') The lexeme sadʒdʒ-aa-dúma ‘30’ is slightly irregular: it contains dʒdʒ as a second stem consonant while the basic numeral sás-o ‘3’ has a stem-final s. Note that the numeral tor-dúma ‘10’ contains an element tor-, the numerals from 11 to 19 are based on another allomorph of ‘10’, namely too-. Whereas the long vowel between the multiplier ‘two’ and the multiplicand ‘ten’ is -oo in lamoo-dúma '20', it is ee for the numbers between 21 and 29; see, for instance, lam-ée-na hezzéetto ‘28’. All other numbers consisting of tens plus units are generated in a regular way and the long vowel of the tens is retained in the tens plus units; see, for instance, sadʒdʒ-aa-dúma ‘30’ and sadʒdʒ-áa-na ónto ‘35’. The numbers t’ibbíta ‘100’ and kumíta ‘1000’ are not case and gender-agreeing numeral attributes but feminine nouns. With the younger generation, kumíta is being replaced by the Amharic loan ʃii '1000'. The numeral milooná ‘one million’, a masculine noun, is borrowed from European languages via Amharic. As modifiers of a head noun, the numeral nouns are always encoded in the genitive case. Source: Treis, Yvonne 2007. Cardinal numerals in Kambaata. In: Machalík, Tomáš and Jan Záhořík (eds.).

Amis has a typical decimal system found in most Western Austronesian languages. The data are converted to IPA symbols based on the speakers’ transcription/orthography. Notice that in Amis, the glottal stop before and after vowels are optionally transcribed, and vowels /u/ and /o/ are used as free variations and the the symbol [ʡ] is an epiglottal plosive. (1) According to Tsuchida (1988), there are five major dialects in Amis: Sakizaya (or Sakiraya), Northern (or Nanshi Amis), Tavalong-Vataan, Central, (Haian Amis and Hsiukulan Amis excluding Tavalong-Vataan) and Southern (Peinan Amis and Hengchun Amis). Sakizaya has been politically recognized as an independent language by the government of Taiwan, and hence, its data will not be listed in the table. Notice that Tsuchida’s classification is slightly different from the dialects officially recognized by the Taiwanese government, which are Northern, Central (including Tavalong-Vataan Amis and Hsiukulan Amis in Tsuchida’ classification), Haian, Malan (or Falangaw, roughly corresponding to Peinan Amis in Tsuchida’s classification), and Hengchun. The examples from Vataan are collected from Hui- Mei Lin, a native speaker of this dialect. The rest of the examples are cited from the 1000-word Vocabulary List published by the Council of Indigenous Peoples: 1229CD7C. However, I have made some corrections after double checking with the native speakers. The List published on-line still needs further proof-reading and revision.

The speaker of Vataan only provides me muɁtəp here. I am not sure if it can be used in serial counting in this dialect. (3) Sabaw or safaw roughly means the “the decimal digit”. tu is the oblique case (4) ''a'' in 20 and other tens is a a linker. It shows up between a modifier and a noun. (5) “maləbut” or “ləfot” originally means “angry”. It is used metaphorically here as when one has to count up to 1000, one might get impatient and angry.",0.246913580246914,1,NA

In fact, it's possible that the fijɛ occuring in the 20's is the word 'thing' as they have the same morphological shape and I've heard reports of similar cases in other Cameroonian languages. The concord marking changes to match the noun when using the numbers with nouns (and is still limited to the digits 1-5 in the one's positions). When used with nouns, the concord also occurs with the single digits 1-5 (eg, fi-ɲi fi-mimia 'one bird', mu-ɲi muɱ-fɛ 'two birds'). -""100"" is intrinsically gender 3/4, which in Nchane has a labialized initial consonant marking singular and presumably 0 marking plural (ie, #Cw 'cl3' and #C 'cl4', eg, gwaŋ 'hill' and gaŋ 'hills'). -""1000"" is intrinsically gender 1/2, which is marked 0-/ba- respectively (eg 0-na 'cow' and ba-na 'cows').

The list above contains the number words which are still commonly considered to be “true Safaliba” and not borrowed, and are still in current use among speakers age 40+ and some of the younger generation depending on individual factors. Some younger speakers who do not use the Gonja words, use the above list but substitute /pee/ ‘ten’ for /kporigo/ (which is obviously an ‘older’ word for ‘ten’) when the words is used in combination with ‘toko’ for the numbers between 20 and 100. Finally, a few additional different words have been reported for some of the smaller numbers (<10), but these are only known by some of the very elderly (age 65+) and are not in current usage. Safaliba has two tones (High and Low), which have both lexical and grammatical functions. Automatic downstep causes high tones following low tones to have a lower pitch than the previous high tone. Sometimes a lowered high tone occurs following a high tone—this is marked by the down-step symbol (IPA [́] as in the word ànáásí 'four', above), but since its pitch is lowered to exactly the same degree as a ordinary high tone with automatic downstep, such tones are analyzed as “downstepped high tones” and not a third (“mid”) tone.

At the time, it was customary for Italian scholars to leave out Arabic loanwords in their Berber wordlists. The gap of 4-9 almost certainly indicates that those numerals were Arabic. The reason why 10,12,17,19 and 30 are attested, is because Sarnelli was able to elicit the cryptic numerals, which intentionally avoid Arabic numerals so Berber speakers can talk about prices on the marketplace without being understood. Similar cryptic numeral systems are found in el-Foqaha Siwa and probably Awjila. 10 translates to ‘hands’ 12 translates to ‘two hands and two fingers’ 17 translates to ‘three hands and two of fingers’ 19 translates to ‘hands and feet without finger’ 30 translate to ‘month’.

Here at long last are the Saxwe numeral data. A few notes: 1) Please disregard the yellow highlighting. For some reason, Word did not allow me to type a consonant followed by ṹ. When I tried to do that, it transformed the ṹ into a copy of the preceding consonant. In other words, when I typed ""kōnũ̀kṹwê"" it gave me ""kōnũ̀kkwê"". I don't know why it did this; I've never seen anything like it before. When I highlighted some letters, I obtained the correct form. So the highlighting isn't there to signal anything, just to ensure that the proper form shows. 2) For the number 1, there are two forms. When counting in the abstract, you use ɑ̀ɖé. So ""one, two, three, four..."" would be ɑ̀ɖé, òwê, ɑ̀tɔ̃̂, ɛ̀nɛ̃̂... But if you want to count actual items, for instance ""one car"" or ""one mango"", you'd use ɖókpó. 3) I can give you morpheme-by-morpheme breakdowns of the longer numbers if you want. For example, 27 is ""20 5 and 2"". 4) I'm not sure that there's a good word for 1000. Traditional counting doesn't go that high.
