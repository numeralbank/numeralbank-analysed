We have, therefore, the phenomenon of a people inventing a series of numerals for themselves which is decimal, and using it in a game, while they continue to use for ordinary purposes their old notation, the basis of which is quinary. ... sa, though never used as one in Mota, is in fact the same as tea, which appears in the Mota word for six and qasa 1, the first qa, corresponds to qaru 6, the second qa ... It is very remarkable that in counting in the game of tika, and in that only, a regular decimal series of Numerals is in use ... These Numerals appear to be peculiar to Mota, and of native invention, none of them corresponding to the Numerals of other islands.","false",NA,NA,NA
